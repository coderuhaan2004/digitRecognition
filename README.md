# Digit Recognition using Neural networks
This is my first Neural network project

1. Download all the files into one folder
2. Make sure tensorflow and Pillow is installed. Install them running the commands ```pip install tensorflow``` and ```pip install Pillow``` on terminal
3. Run ```draw.py``` file by running the command ```python3 draw.py```
4. Draw a digit on the canvas and it predicts the digit (predictions may not be accurate). Right click twice the clear the screen for second input.
